A little bit about me: I grew up in Brooklyn, and fell in love with country life after moving away for college. I've managed <a title="The Bicycle Depot" href="http://bicycledepot.com" target="_blank">a local bike shop </a>, gotten my feet wet in local politics as a campaign communication coordinator for <a title="Mike Hein for Ulster County Executive" href="http://www.heinforexec.com/" target="_blank">our County Executive</a> and played a key role as part of a <a title="VisionScape Interactive, LLC" href="http://www.visionscape.com" target="_blank">growing startup</a>. I'm now the President at <a title="DragonSearch" href="http://www.dragonsearchmarketing.com" target="_blank">DragonSearch</a>, a digital marketing company with offices in Manhattan and Kingston, NY.

A great day is spent bringing new and exciting business into our agency, riding my cyclocross bike on local trails and making dinner for my lovely wife (<a title="Eileen Writes Code" href="http://www.eileencodes.com/" target="_blank">who has a great blog</a>, if you're interested in Ruby and Rails).
